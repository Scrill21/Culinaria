### Summary:

### Focus Areas:
My primary areas of focus were the networking layer, testing, and error handling. I chose to concentrate on these components because I believe that building a scalable and reliable networking architecture, supported by comprehensive test coverage and robust error handling, provides a strong foundation that significantly benefits future development and maintenance.

### Time Spent:
I dedicated approximately 10 to 13 hours to this project. The initial 5–6 hours were focused on ideation, setting up the foundational architecture, and developing the core components, including the model, view models, `RecipesView`, `RecipeDetailsView`, and the basic networking layer.

The following 4 hours were spent refactoring the networking layer to enhance scalability and maintainability, as well as implementing unit tests to ensure code reliability.

An additional 2–3 hours were allocated to implementing filtering functionality, integrating image caching, incorporating `SFSafariViewController` for displaying external links (e.g., source and YouTube URLs), and refining the user interface.

The remaining time was used for final review to verify that all requirements were met, recording a demonstration of the app, and writing required documentation in the README file.

### Trade-offs and Decisions:
The primary trade-off I made was deprioritizing the user interface in favor of establishing a solid architectural foundation. While I aimed to maintain a clean and functional UI, my main focus was on building robust underlying systems to ensure long-term scalability and maintainability.

### Weakest Part of the Project:
The user interface is currently the weakest aspect of my project. The improvements would include implementing a launch screen, replacing the `List` in `RecipesView` with a `ScrollView` and a custom view to present the recipe content in a more refined and visually appealing manner. Additionally, I would reposition the filter menu to the navigation bar using a `.toolbarItem`, and enhance the overall visual experience by introducing a more vibrant and cohesive color scheme throughout the application.

### Additional Information
I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate my skills and thoroughly enjoyed working on this project.
